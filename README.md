Welcome to the Projects Memory System Utilization Project repository! 
This project focuses on optimizing memory system utilization using Docker, Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). In today's dynamic computing landscape, efficient resource management is paramount, and 
that's where our project comes in. By harnessing the power of Docker containers, we encapsulate applications and their dependencies, ensuring consistency across various environments. 
The Docker images are seamlessly pushed to Amazon ECR, providing a secure and scalable container image registry.
Leveraging the capabilities of Amazon EKS, we achieve efficient orchestration and deployment of these containers into a Kubernetes cluster. 
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide, offering step-by-step instructions, configuration templates, and 
best practices for achieving optimal memory utilization while streamlining the deployment process. Whether you're a seasoned DevOps professional or
just stepping into the world of containerization and orchestration, this project will provide valuable insights and hands-on experience. 
Join us on this journey towards mastering memory-efficient system utilization with Docker, ECR, and EKS
